# ITU ROV Team üê≥

The **ITU ROV Team** is a multidisciplinary student group from **Istanbul Technical University**, developing cutting-edge underwater robots. Established under the Faculty of Shipbuilding and Marine Sciences, our team has 8 years of experience in creating innovative solutions for underwater challenges. We continuously push the boundaries of autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) through teamwork, dedication, and a commitment to excellence.

## About ROVs

**Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)** are underwater systems designed for tasks that are otherwise unreachable or challenging for humans. These vehicles are crucial in areas such as:

- **Inspection and maintenance** of offshore platforms and underwater pipelines
- **Environmental monitoring** of underwater habitats
- **Scientific exploration** in deep-sea environments

ROVs are equipped with high-resolution cameras, robotic arms, and advanced sensors to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively.
